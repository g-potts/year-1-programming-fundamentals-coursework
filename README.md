# year-1-programming-fundamentals-coursework
This coursework was the summary of what we learnt in our first programming module, in which we learnt Java, Object-Oriented Programming and the foundations of computational thinking and logic.\
The labs were smaller problems set weekly to practice individual concepts, for example creating classes and objects, or error handling. The code was tested against pre-existing JTests.
The coursework was one larger project in which we modelled a car trading and auctioneering system. Given business rules and UML diagrams, we built classes representing each component, for example, a car, an auctioneer, or a person bidding.
This taught me to manage the relations between classes, the way the interact, and any constraints on fields such as how a name is formatted or whether or not a bid would be successful.\
The style and formatting of our code was also assessed to make sure our code stayed readable and followed the rules a workplace would enforce.
